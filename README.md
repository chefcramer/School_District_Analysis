## Overview of the School District Analysis
A school board employee has given us the following tasks to analyise a set of data in a school district with a school that is suspected of altering testing data. The suspect data will be removed, specifically the Math and Reading test scores for the 9th graders at Thomas High School, and the impact on the overall data will be analysed

1. How is the district summary affected when the suspect data is removed?
2. How is the school summary affected when the suspect data is removed?
3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and Reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type
